			<h3>We met in college...</h3>
			<p>
				...in September 2009 at Massey Theatre on campus at Robert Morris University. We would like to say we hit it off right away and fell deeply in love, but truth be told it was nothing like that. Our friendship got started on the wrong foot, leading to a semester of being on less-than friendly terms. It took almost a year, but we eventually came around to our inevitable compatability; it was only a matter of time. And as the saying goes, the rest is history.
			</p>
			<p>
				The past 7 years of getting to know each other have been an adventure. We graduated and joined the workforce, traveled to and lived in multiple cities, adopted two kitties that we spoil like children, and started building a life together.

			<h3>In the very same theater where we first met...</h3>
			<p>
				...Chris worked with the director, Barbara Burgess-Lefebvre, to arrange a surprise! Thanks to so many creative friends and Ashley's predictable propensity for being on stage, a plan was born.
			</p>
			<p>
				About a month before, we were asked to be "Celebrity Guest Judges" for RMU's Play in a Day...or so Ashley thought. Barbara graciously rigged the event, choosing the theme "It's About Time" as a jab at Chris for waiting so long. Fast foward to Barbara's show, Ashley found herself on stage answering odd questions about her life. Little did she know, Chris had snuck most of their friends and family into the theater under the guise of helping tech the shows.
			</p>
			<p>
				After a few minutes of questioning, Chris burst onto stage, adding to Ashley's building confusion. She found herself being pulled to the front of the stage to the specific spot where they first met. With Ed Sheeran's "We Found Love" playing in the background, Chris got down on one knee and asked Ashley to be his wife "right where we are."
			</p>
			<h3>And...</h3>
